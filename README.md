# Hobby-Tracker

## Description

In our group project we created a hobby tracking web application. The motivation behind this project was to neatly organize a users hobbies in a clean and easy to use web design that is compatible with any hobby. We built this application to because we wanted users to have the ability to manage and store thier different projects at various stages in one location. We also wanted our users to be able to store notes about thier project, upload photos, create a supplies list, look back on past projects and create future projects. With our hobby tracker webpage we are hope to solve the issue of disorganized projects, especially when there are multiple projects involved. Through out the build of this project we were able to gain a more indepth grasp of back-end developing by spending more time working with bcrypt, dotenv, express, express-session, handlebars, mysql, and sequelize. We also learned the importance of having a clear and organized plan before we start writing the first lines of code. Having this clean and consise plan allowed us to fully understand the direction of the project, an organized sequential order of operations, and a clear understanding of each team members roles as the project evolved. We learned that spending time up front allowed us to run a smooth and effiecent project build. We were given the challenge of using one new library, package or technology that we haven't discussed in class. We chose to learn and impement GraphicsMagick, a package that allows the user to upload images to our web application in a variety of formats including DPX, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, JXL, PNG, PDF, PNM, TIFF, and WebP.
